# GNN_study
This is a repo to help introduce the concept of GNN's to those new to the field
## Organzation
The plain Python files in the main directory (layers.py train.py, models.py, and utils.py) are there to demonstrate how to build a GNN from the ground up. They show how to implement the matrix multiplication as well as useful functions for dealing with GNNs. PYG.ipynb is a jupyter notebook demonstrating simpler ways to create GNNs using Pytorch Geometric (PyG).
The remaining files are example test and train files used by the model.
